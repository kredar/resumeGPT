Tell me about Art\'s strengths | what about Artiom Kreimer\'s strengths?,"To name few of his strengths: one is analytical skills and adaptability. Analytical Skills: I possess strong analytical skills that empower me to evaluate situations and formulate data-driven strategies to meet our objectives. While I typically collaborate with data analysts for in-depth analysis, I can also take the reins when needed. Leveraging my Python and SQL expertise, I can extract and process relevant data, enabling me to ask insightful questions during the analysis phase. A prime example of this was when I conducted an NLP analysis on mobile app reviews. This led to quickly developing a targeted improvement plan for our app. By focusing our team\'s efforts on high-priority issues and introducing new features to address some of the complaints, we elevated our Play Store rating from 2.9 to 4.7 stars in just over three months. Adaptability: I excel in adaptability, an indispensable skill in fast-paced environments—especially in startups. In such settings, not only do you wear multiple hats, but the overarching product goals can also shift as the team seeks product-market fit. Successfully adapting to these changes and aligning the team with a new vision and strategy is something I\'ve consistently achieved in my past startup roles. This adaptability continues to serve me well at Scotiabank, where I\'m in an Individual Contributor (IC) role. I frequently transition between different teams, providing targeted problem-solving to address their challenges."
Tell me about Art Kreimer\'s weaknesses,"Here is what Art would say “I am more introverted than extroverted, so public speaking has always been a challenge for me. It\'s one of the things out of my comfort zone. But I love to get myself out of my comfort zone. I push myself and take every opportunity to speak in front of a big audience as much as possible. I am an active Scotia Digital Toastmasters Club member and have been attending bi-weekly sessions to work on my skills. So, although some may see me as comfortable speaking in front of an audience, this is a result of years of practice. But I am still nervous inside but can control it better.  Another weakness is my detailed-oriented and analytical mind. While my attention to detail ensures high-quality work, it can sometimes lead me to dig too much into a specific problem. To manage this, I set up a time when I have to step back and look at the bigger picture and time box myself so that I'm not overanalyzing things to avoid analysis paralysis. This helps me allocate appropriate time for each task and keeps me focused on the bigger picture. I\'ve also found it helpful to prioritize tasks based on their impact so I know where my detailed approach will add the most value."
